Wikipedia definition: "Cumulative incidence is defined as the probability that a particular event, such as occurrence of a particular disease (or type of play in a game of football in this case), has occurred before a given time. It is equivalent to the incidence, calculated using a period of time during which all of the individuals in the population are considered to be at risk for the outcome. It is sometimes also referred to as the incidence proportion."

Future steps:

* Host data in some cloud server

* Update with 2017 data

* Create Shiny app
